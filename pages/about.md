## About the Project

This project maps makerspaces in public libraries in southern Ontario. As a prototype, two library systems are included: Toronto Public Library and Hamilton Public Library. Explore the [Map](/map.html) or <b>Browse</b> word clouds for [space types](/spaces.html) and [library systems](/locations.html) and to find makerspaces of [all sorts](/browse.html) in the region. Each corresponding page includes a description of the tools, equipment and space available; the location information of the branch; and a link to the library's website for more information. [Search](/search/index.html) the full index by keyword to find matching makerspaces, or view the [Listing](/data.html) for the complete directory. 
<br>
<br>

The goal of this website is to support a community of makers and connect public library makerspaces. The Resources section includes a [reading list](/resources.html) of resource materials, [programming and project ideas](/projects.html), and suggestions for browsing the [library shelves](/dewey.html) for more.
