##### A Note About Marketing
Libraries need to consider how they will advertise and market their programs to their community. It is wise to allocate a modest budget for marketing, while still taking advantage of free forms of advertisement such as social media posts or placing events on the library website. Libraries must also consider what kinds of programs would appeal to their community, and whether the library can collaborate with an existing maker community in their area to boost awareness of library facilities and programs. One interesting tip is that community members may be intimidated by a long-running program series and may be more inclined to attend a one day, pop-up, or special event rather than committing to a weekly activity or joining a weekly program part way through its run. Having an open house could also boost community awareness of what your makerspace can offer.
